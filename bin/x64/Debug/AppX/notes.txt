Minor problems:

I made a public getter for the dots in the DotManger. I do not know if we want to keep this field private or not.

I made two timers with the GameManager, just so it will be easier to tell the Survival Time, and new wave interval time.

When setting the color for the East and West dots, I call the method in every tick. I did this because
when I tried to set the color only when a new dot was created, it changes the color a late, and the first
color was visible for a moment.
